# Day21 Challenge: K8s Upgrade Mastery: From Minikube to EKS


Hello Learners,


Welcome back to another thrilling episode of the DevOps SRE Daily Challenge! ðŸŽ‰ 

In the world of Kubernetes, keeping your clusters up-to-date isnâ€™t just a best practiceâ€”itâ€™s essential for ensuring security, stability, and access to the latest features.</br> 
For DevOps engineers, SREs, and Kubernetes certification candidates, mastering cluster upgrades across diverse environments is a critical skill.

Whether youâ€™re managing clusters in local development environments, production-grade cloud infrastructures, or anything in between, understanding the nuances of different upgrade strategies will make you a Kubernetes pro!



## Why Cluster Upgrades Matter for Your Exam
### Real-World Relevance:
- Upgrading clusters is a routine task in production environments to patch vulnerabilities, improve performance, and enable new features.
- Understanding these processes prepares you for managing real-world Kubernetes workloads.

### Certification Preparation:
- Tasks related to version upgrades are commonly seen in certification exams like CKA. Being familiar with these workflows will save you valuable time during the test.

### Managed vs. Self-Hosted Clusters:
- Understanding the differences between upgrading managed Kubernetes services like EKS and self-hosted clusters is essential.
- Managed services often abstract some complexities but still require careful planning to ensure compatibility and performance.
- Self-hosted clusters offer more control but demand a deeper understanding of the upgrade process.

### Best Practices:
- Always test upgrades in staging or non-production environments first.
- Backup your cluster and critical data before initiating any upgrade.
- Read the release notes carefully for deprecations and breaking changes.
- Automate where possible to ensure consistency and reduce human errors.


## Challenge Tasks
### Theory Challenge: Understanding Cluster Upgrades
  1. Why Upgrade Clusters?
  2. Explain the importance of upgrading Kubernetes clusters in real-world scenarios.
  3. Discuss the risks of outdated cluster versions.
  4. Upgrade Strategies:  What are the typical upgrade approaches for Kubernetes clusters (e.g., rolling upgrades, blue-green deployments)?
  5. When should you choose one strategy over another?
  6. Managed vs. Self-Hosted Clusters: Highlight the key differences in upgrade processes for managed services like EKS and self-hosted clusters using tools like Kubeadm.
  7. Discuss the unique challenges and best practices for each.


### Practical Challenge: Upgrading Clusters in Different Environments

1. Minikube Cluster Upgrade
    - Upgrade your existing Minikube setup to the latest version.
    - Verify that the Kubernetes version in the cluster matches the latest stable release.


2. Kind Cluster Upgrade
   - Create a Kind cluster using an older Kubernetes version (e.g., v1.30.8).
   - Upgrade kind cluster to latest version
   - Confirm the version upgrade with kubectl version.


3. Kubeadm Cluster Upgrade
   - Create a multi-node Kubernetes cluster using Kubeadm.
   - Upgrade the Control Plane and Nodes to a newer Kubernetes version.
   - Verify that all components (kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager, kube-scheduler, etc.) are updated.



4. EKS Cluster Upgrade
  - Upgrade the EKS Control Plane to a newer version using AWS CLI.
  - Update the node groups to match the Control Plane version.
  - Confirm the upgrade with kubectl version.

<b>Note:</b> 
``` EKS also provides an auto mode for node groups, which simplifies the process of keeping your nodes up-to-date. While this reduces manual intervention, itâ€™s important to monitor the process and validate workloads after the upgrade to ensure seamless transitions.```

### Best Practices:
- Monitor your workloads during the upgrade to ensure there are no disruptions.
- Use a phased approach to minimize risks in production.
- Leverage EKS version release notes and upgrade tools to plan your upgrades effectively.


### Submission Guidelines
1. Your answers to the theory questions.
2. Screenshots of:
  - The pre-upgrade and post-upgrade versions for each cluster.
  - Key commands executed during the upgrade process.
  - Document your observations and challenges during the upgrades.
3. Post your progress with the hashtags: #KubernetesUpgrades, #DevOpsForAll, #ckawithsagar
