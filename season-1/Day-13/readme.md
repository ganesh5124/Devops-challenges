# Day 13 Challenge: Mastering Docker Volumes for Persistent Applications

Hello Learners,

Welcome back to the DevOps SRE Daily Challenge! ðŸŽ‰

After exploring Docker networking yesterday, today weâ€™ll focus on Docker Volumes, an essential feature for persisting data across container restarts and enabling data sharing between containers.

By the end of this challenge, youâ€™ll gain a hands-on understanding of how to use Docker volumes to manage stateful applications effectively.



## What Are Docker Volumes?
- Docker volumes are a way to persist data generated and used by Docker containers.
- Unlike bind mounts, volumes are managed by Docker, providing flexibility and enhanced functionality for containerized applications.


## Why Docker Volumes Matter
1. Persistence: Ensures data remains even when containers are stopped or removed.
2. Isolation: Volumes are isolated from the host file system, improving security.
3. Sharing: Easily share data between containers.
4. Backup and Migration: Simplifies data backup and movement between environments.

## Key Docker Volume Commands
- List Volumes: ``` docker volume ls```
- Create a Volume: ``` docker volume create my-volume ```
- Inspect a Volume: ``` docker volume inspect my-volume ```
- Remove a Volume: ``` docker volume rm my-volume ```
- Prune Unused Volumes: ``` docker volume prune ```

## Challenge Steps
1. Persist Data for Yelb Components:
   - Use Docker volumes to persist data for Redis and PostgreSQL.
   - Run PostgreSQL with a Volume
   - Create a volume for PostgreSQL data:
     ``` docker volume create pg-data ```
2. Start the PostgreSQL container with the volume:
  ```
  docker run --name yelb-db \
  --network=yelb-network \
  -v pg-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  -d mreferre/yelb-db:0.6
  ```

3. Run Redis with a Volume:
  - Create a volume for Redis data:
    ``` docker volume create redis-data ```
4. Start the Redis container with the volume:
     ``` 
    docker run --name redis-server \
    --network=yelb-network \
    -v redis-data:/data \
    -p 6379:6379 \
    -d redis:4.0.2
    ```

5. Verify Data Persistence:
  - Stop and remove the Redis and PostgreSQL containers:
    ```
      docker stop redis-server yelb-db
      docker rm redis-server yelb-db
    ```
  - Restart the containers and verify that data is retained:
    ```
    docker run --name yelb-db \
    --network=yelb-network \
    -v pg-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
    -p 5432:5432 \
    -d mreferre/yelb-db:0.6
    ```
    
    ```
    docker run --name redis-server \
    --network=yelb-network \
    -v redis-data:/data \
    -p 6379:6379 \
    -d redis:4.0.2
    
6. Inspect Volume Usage
  - Inspect the volumes to confirm they are in use:
    ```
      docker volume inspect pg-data
      docker volume inspect redis-data
    ```

## Submission Guidelines
1. Proof of Completion:
   - Screenshots of the following:
   - Running containers (docker ps).
   - Volume inspection output (docker volume inspect).
   - Redis or PostgreSQL data showing persistence after container restart.
2. Documentation:
   - Steps to set up Docker volumes.
   - Learnings about how Docker volumes work.
   - Challenges faced and how you resolved them.
3. Share Your Progress:
  - Post your experience on social media with the hashtags: #getfitwithsagar, #SRELife, #DevOpsForAll

## Bonus Tasks
- Explore and compare bind mounts with Docker volumes.
- Use docker-compose to define services with volumes.
- Backup and restore data from Docker volumes using docker cp.

## Why This Matters
Understanding Docker volumes is critical for managing stateful applications in production environments. This challenge prepares you to handle real-world scenarios involving data persistence and portability in containerized applications.
