## Why RabbitMQ is Important
RabbitMQ is a popular open-source message broker, and it plays a key role in decoupling services, improving scalability, reliability, and resilience in distributed systems.

## ðŸ”§ What It Does
RabbitMQ acts as a middleman between services. It receives messages from one service (producer), and passes them to another (consumer) â€” reliably and asynchronously.

âœ… Why It's Important
1. Decoupling
Services donâ€™t have to know about each other or wait for each other.

Example: Service A sends data to RabbitMQ and moves on. Service B picks it up later.

2. Asynchronous Processing
Useful when tasks take time (e.g., sending emails, processing images).

Helps keep apps fast and responsive.

3. Scalability
You can scale producers and consumers independently based on load.

4. Reliability
Messages wonâ€™t get lost â€” RabbitMQ can persist them to disk.
Supports retries and acknowledgments.

5. Supports Multiple Messaging Patterns
Pub/Sub, Work Queues, Routing, Topics, etc.

6. Built-in Features
Dead-letter queues
Priority queues
Message TTL (time-to-live)
