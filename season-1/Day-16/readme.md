# DAY16 Challenge: Everything About the CKA Exam

Hello Learners,



Welcome back to the DevOps SRE Daily Challenge! ðŸŽ‰



Today, weâ€™re launching an exciting 30-Day CKA Exam Preparation Series. This series is designed to help you cover all the critical topics necessary to pass the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exam confidently. Over the next 30 days, weâ€™ll dive into each domain of the exam syllabus with hands-on tasks and practical exercises.



## Our 30-Day Plan
### Over the next 30 days, we will:

Focus on Core Domains: Each day, weâ€™ll explore and practice different areas of the [CKA Syllabus](https://github.com/Sagar2366/LearnWithSagar/blob/main/CKA/1_syllabus.md):
```
Day 1â€“7: Cluster setup, installation, and configuration
Day 8â€“15: Workloads and scheduling
Day 16â€“20: Networking and services
Day 21â€“25: Storage, logging, and monitoring
Day 26â€“30: Troubleshooting, exam prep, and mock tests
```

### Work with Hands-On Challenges:
- Each day will feature practical tasks, from setting up a Kubernetes cluster to deploying applications and debugging issues.
- Simulate real exam tasks to help you gain speed and confidence.

### Leverage Resources:
- Rely on Kubernetesâ€™ [official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/) for quick references.
- Use your test environment to practice kubectl commands and troubleshoot issues.


### Why This Plan Matters
- The CKA exam is performance-based, meaning youâ€™ll need to solve real problems quickly. This 30-day plan will:
- Help you gain practical experience with daily challenges.
- Build familiarity with common tasks and commands you'll encounter on the exam.
- Ensure you are well-prepared for the exam environment and its time constraints.

## Tasks
### Understand the Exam Objectives and Domains:
- Read through the exam syllabus and summarize each domain (e.g., Cluster setup, Networking, Storage, etc.).
### Exam Details:
- Summarize the exam format, passing score, exam duration, and resources allowed during the exam.
Discuss why using the official Kubernetes docs during the exam is essential for success.

### Why This Challenge Matters
This foundational challenge sets the stage for your CKA exam preparation. Itâ€™s essential to understand the examâ€™s structure and the resources available to you before you begin tackling more advanced topics. Knowing how to prepare and manage your test environment is just as important as mastering Kubernetes concepts.



## Submission Guidelines
### Proof of Completion:
- A list of CKA domains with examples.
- A summary of the exam details (format, passing score, resources, etc.).
### Share Your Progress:
- Post your experience on social media with the hashtags: #getfitwithsagar, #SRELife, #DevOpsForAll #ckawithsagar
